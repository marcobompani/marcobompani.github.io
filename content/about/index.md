I am a Cyber Security Engineer with 7 years of experience in Blue and Purlpe teaming currently serving at Nielsen.

My main interests are Malware Analysis, Threat Intelligence, Adversary Emulation and Forensics.

I have been awarded with the Lethal Forensicator coin by SANS institute in Advanced Digital Forensics, Incident Response and Threat Hunting.

I also enjoy lifting weights and talking about personal finance.
